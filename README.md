# Small-Induced-Cycles-Algorithm
This algorithm is developed to find all small induced cycles of size 3 to 8 of any complex graph or lage molecular systems.  
The code is written in MATLAB and C++.   
The input (adjacency matrix) must be nxn where n is the number of vertices of G.  In the SmallCycles file, some chemical structures are included in "DrV_Data" file.  
Output is sets of all cycles of size 3 to 8. Results will be saved in a file called "Results_345678", The code will create a result file in side the file "DrV_Data".
