# Small-Induced-Cycles-Algorithm
This algorithm is a polynomial time algorithm, developed to find all small induced cycles of size 3 to 8 of any complex graph or lage molecular systems.  
The code is written in MATLAB.   
The input (adjacency matrix) must be nxn where n is the number of vertices of G. 
Output is sets of all cycles of size 3 to 8.
